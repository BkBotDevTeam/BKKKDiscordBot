- Made the bot only toxic on tuesdays
- Added counters for "nice", "lmao", and "toxic" reacts to users messages
- Fixed bug with call time being broken and only logging the duration of the previous connection
- Fixed a bug with the s3 bucket where uploads would overwrite one another and so counters would be removed

## V 0.0.X

- Previous to this point, all the features and development notes were made with git commits. It has been a messy process, and one I do not wish to detail in these previous version lists.
