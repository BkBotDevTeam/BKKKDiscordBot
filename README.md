# ~BKKK Discord Bot

This repository is used for the Discord Bot used in ~BKKK Server. The server is dedicated to friends of the Authors. The bot is used for any features that we wanted to implement into our server without including other bots, to have a fully customisable experience.

## Getting Started

This is not public at the moment, as such a getting started is not included. For information purposes, the bot is hosted on an AWS server and the development environment is automatically deployed on the server using AWS's CodeDeploy.

## Todo

There is a full todo readme found at [TODO](/README.md)
